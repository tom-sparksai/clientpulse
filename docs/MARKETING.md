ClientPulse gives your clients a live view of their projects. Progress tracking, in-project chat, file sharing, and invoicing — all in a beautiful portal they'll actually use. No more status update emails.

### Maker Comment
Hey PH! 👋

We built ClientPulse because we were tired of the constant "where are we?" emails from clients.

As a dev agency, we spend hours every week just updating clients. So we built a dashboard that does it automatically — live progress, instant chat, file sharing.

Your clients get a magic link portal (no signup!). You get your time back.

We'd love your feedback! 🙏
